A database is an organized collection of data stored and managed electronically on a computer system. It's like a digital filing cabinet,
but instead of paper files, it holds information in a structured format. This structure makes it efficient to store, retrieve, update, 
and manage large amounts of data.

I learned introduction to SQL elements such as Literals, Datatype, NULLs and comments.
Also understanding of SQL syntax and structure using DDL and DML.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with relational databases.It allows users to define, manipulate, control, and query data in databases.
Basic SQL syntax consists of statements that perform specific tasks. Common commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.






SELECT customer_name, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE order_total > 1000;

SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
FROM: Indicates the table to query.
WHERE: Filters the data based on specified conditions.



CREATE TABLE:Creates a new table with specified columns and data types.
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);



ALTER TABLE:Modifies an existing table by adding, dropping, or modifying columns.
ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone_number VARCHAR(20);



DROP TABLE:Deletes an entire table and its data.
DROP TABLE customers;
